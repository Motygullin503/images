Those villages that generate in savanna and plains have wooden and stone block in structure, however the main material in deserts is sandstone.",

You cat climb to the roof by using a ladder inside the house.\n\n A big house - it's one of the main houses in a village. Firstly, it's huge, secondly, it's a spawnplace of almost all villagers in the village. And thirdly, this building bears a striking resemblance to an average country house.\n\n A butcher's house - it's a famous building with a table made from fence and a pressure plate and chairs made from stairs. The feature of this building - it has its own yard, in which you can get only by using a door in the house. Here you can find a villager, who works here. He's wearing a white working apron. You can usually stumble on another villager - a farmer, who is probably buying something.\n\n A library - it's a narrow house, where you can find some chairs, tables and bookshelves and also a workbench in another corner of the building. Here you can find a librarian in a white bathrobe, who spawns in this building.\n\n A farm - it's a plot of land with some plants growing on it. It can be of two sizes - big and small. A big farm is a combination of two small ones. In the small farm you can find 4 rows of garden beds separated by a water channel in 2 parts. The farm is surrounded by wood blocks and the big farm is also separated by the row of wood. The farm can be found near the hut. There can be found wheat, carrots, potatoes. Since 1.8 update villagers in brown boilersuits can collect the crops and plant new seeds.\n\n A well - it's a simple well with infinite water supply. There is only one well in each village and it is situated in the center of the village.\n\n A smithy - it's an attractive building made of cobblestone and iron bars with a lava source. It's the most adorable place among Minecraft players, because here you can find a chest with something interesting inside. Sometimes instead of a chest you can find an Ender chest.\n\n A church - it's a small high building made of cobblestone and cobblestone stairs. It has 2 floors and a view point. The windows are made of glass panels. You can find a priest in a red bathrobe. Also there can be a bug, when up to 8 churches can be generated in the village.\n\n A torch - it's a simple torch, which has an interesting appearance - it's made of fence, black wool and 4 torches around it.\n\n Road - it's a piece of land made from gravel and cobblestone. It has 3 blocks in width and 2 in depth.",
