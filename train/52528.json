If you intend to use this application in hunting, check first your local game law for legal use. Best results are achieved with an external speaker connected to your phones audio jack (if available).To play a call, tap the button with the desired sound. To stop the sound press the button again or press another button to change call.\n\n1. Locater Bugle\nThis sound is made when bulls want to let know where they are and find out where other elk are. It's a good elk sound to make first thing in the early morning before or just after daylight to help you decide where to go in pursuit of elk. If you get a response from the call stop calling and start walking. Knock off about a third of the perceived distance and listen for the bull. Do some soft cow chirps and mews and see if you can get him to speak up again. If he does and there's still time and distance, reduce the distance by another third.\n\n2. Challenge Bugle\nThis is a sound made by a bull to intimidate other bulls.If everything else has failed to call in a responding bull, hit him with the challenge bugle and try having him come in for a fight. Do this call at close distance. Most of the times it blows him away but every now and then bulls get excited and come in screaming mad.\n\n3. Chirp\nThe chirp is used to check in on calves and other animals within a herd and is the most basic contact vocalization among elks. It's a call that can be used in mid-day hunting while bulls are up and stretching their legs. Hit them with chirps they might come and check you out.It can also be used to position an animal for shooting. If the animal didn't quite hear where the call came from and starts shifting ears hit them with a chirp.The call signalizes a relaxed feeling and can be used when you are approaching an animal to signal, \"everything is all right\".The calf has a high pitch sound and adult animals very in pitch with lower pitch for older animals.\n\n4. Assembly Mew\nThis call is a specific vocalization made by adult cows and more mature animals.It is a call that implies a direct action for other animals to come here. Often animals that respond to this call come fast and without much sound so be ready.This call can be very effective in heavy hunted areas and on lone bulls during the pre-rut.It is also a direct reply to the \"Lost Mew\".\n\n5. Lost Mew\nThis is a call made by animals that are out of the herd. It asks for a response from the the animals in the herd. Note it does not ask the animals to to come to you asherd with the \"Assembly Call\". The meaning of the call is \"Where are you so that I can come to you?\"Use this call to locate animals and then approach them. There are occasions when someone from the herd will come and look for you so watch out. \n\n6. Lost Calf Mew\nThis is the same as the \"Lost Mew\" call but the sound made by calves.Use this sound to approach group of animals. Do the call often and approach the herd. There is also good chance that someone will come and look for you. Notice that the animals can come quite fast towards you with this call. \n\n7. Hyper Hot Estrus\nThis is a call cows in estrus might do when they get desperate toward the end of their estrus cycle. It's a pleading to have all willing bulls come in. Try this call when nothing else brings in the bulls. If you do this call at the right time bulls can get stupid quite fast. The best time is around end of September. \n\n",
