      "text": "Dungeons are naturally generated structures that appear in the Overworld.\n\n They are small rooms made of Cobblestone and Moss Stone and contain a hostile Mob Spawner and up to 2 Chests. Finding a dungeon without a chest is very unlikely, but possible. Occasionally, a dungeon will spawn with its chests in such a way as to create a double chest. Dungeons generate with either a zombie, skeleton, or spider spawner that can easily be deactivated by placing torches all around the spawner.\n\n Anyone exploring a cavern should be wary of encountering a dungeon, as they are almost always connected to large caverns. Also, a dungeon generated near the surface of a desert biome will cause sand to collapse and form a square depression. This can be a good way for inexperienced players to locate a dungeon and the resources associated with them.\n\n Dungeons do exist on Peaceful mode, as they are generated with the map. Monster Spawners will still spawn mobs in peaceful mode, but the mobs will instantly despawn.\n\n A mob spawner can be found there. The mob spawner acts as a guard for the loot, spawning an indefinite number of mobs until the player can light up the room sufficiently to stop new mobs from being spawned, or simply break the spawner itself. This is usually accomplished by placing a torch on or around the spawner. The mob spawner is always in the center of the dungeon room, with chests located around the walls of the room (large chests can connect with the short side against the wall). The chests contain randomly generated treasure that are placed in random slots.\n\n A spawner in a dungeon has 50% chance of being a Zombie spawner, 25% chance of producing Skeletons, and 25% chance of producing Spiders.\n\n It is usually fairly easy to convert a dungeon to a minifarm for experience and drops, but the details will vary with the dungeon's location and environment. However, the spawner will not activate unless the player is standing within 15 blocks of it.\n\n Dungeons can generate almost anywhere underground, but they are most common around Layer 26, and frequent between Layers 16 and 42.\n\n A reliable way of locating dungeons is through listening, either for a large amount of noise from one kind of mob, or for ambience. Neither of these things are an exclusive trait of a dungeon, but they do mean that there is an unlit and unexplored area nearby, which may well be a dungeon, particularly in the case of frequent, similar mob noises.\n\n Some ways to locate a dungeon include searching for moss stone inside of a cave and looking in abandoned mine shafts, as well as looking for cobblestone not placed by players (and not lava-related).",
