A kitchen sink needs to be large in size so it can easily accommodate big bowls, pots, pans, and any other utensil that one might use to prepare food. The kitchen sink must also be able to withstand the abuse of these large, heavy objects.  Most people know that smaller objects like glasses, plates and silverware can create scratches and nicks in kitchen sinks. Larger objects can do serious damage to sinks that are not made to withstand a certain amount of daily wear and tear. For this reason, normally heavy gauge stainless steel kitchen sinks are a favorite but have had some stiff competition in the past few years. More and more consumers are going with the porcelain coated cast iron. These delightful additions are very popular with the shabby chic look and the vintage kitchens.",
