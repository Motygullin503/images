Vanilla multiplayer servers also start at the beginning of daytime, but the cycle ignores new players joining, so the cycle could be at any point when any particular player first spawn into a server.\n Daytime features the Sun and a light blue sky. This color depends on the biome you are currently in. Deserts and Forests have a turquoise sky, while Tundra and Taiga have a more blue sky.\n If placed in the Overworld using external editors or superflat codes, the End's biome has a black sky all day. The Nether's biome, however, has a normal sky when edited into the Overworld.\n During daytime, all blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky receive daylight, the strongest light possible, which is light level 15.\n Daylight provides ample light for the growth of all trees and crops.\n During daytime zombies will be set on fire while being not in shade.",

The day/night cycle will be the same length with the same effects even if the Sun is visibly larger or smaller. The Sun will also get visibly larger when it sets.\n Between dusk and dawn you may sleep in a bed. In single-player mode, doing so will advance the day-night cycle to dawn. This will also occur in multiplayer if every player online is in a bed simultaneously. Time doesn't pass with regards to other aspects of the world, though. Crops won't grow, and items in furnaces won't cook, for example, although active weather effects usually stop.\n The exact threshold time at which hostile mobs start being able to spawn in exposed areas is 13187.\n This is the equivalent of 19:11:13 in real time.",
