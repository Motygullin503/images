Now l Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,1 three days' journey in breadth.2  4  Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”  5  m And the people of Nineveh believed God. n They called for a fast and o put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.  \nThe People of Nineveh Repent\n6  The word reached1 the king of Nineveh, and p he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, q and sat in ashes.  7  And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, r “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor s beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water,  8  but let man and s beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. t Let everyone turn from his evil way and from u the violence that is in his hands.  9  v Who knows? God may turn and relent w and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish.”  \n10  When God saw what they did, x how they turned from their evil way, x God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.  \n",
