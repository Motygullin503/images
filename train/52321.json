The child is safe and sound, but the boy's father is facing serious charges. Officers found a 3-year-old boy, Jayden, around 11:30 a.m. walking around at an apartment complex on Fieldstone Road. Police say Jayden's feet and pants were soaked. A resident in the area spotted the boy and called 911. Officers responded to the complex, but Jayden was only able to tell them his name, the color of his home and that he had a shed in his backyard. With the help of social media and the public, police say investigators were able to track down Jayden's mother in Hudson. He was released into her custody. Police say Jayden's mother shares custody with his father, 35-year-old Joseph Killgren. They say Jayden was staying with Killgren Wednesday night when he escaped the apartment. Killgren has been charged with endangering the welfare of a minor. Police say Jayden walked out the front door when Killgren fell asleep while watching a movie.  Killgren was ordered held on $5,000 bail. He is slated to be arraigned Friday in Derry District Court. Jayden's mother, Sarah McGrade, says she was at the movie theater when she learned from a friend that her son had been reported missing. The incident is under investigation. The Department of Children and Family Services has been notified.",

Police said that officers were called to the home earlier in the day to help with the eviction of two residents. \"He was utterly shocked,\" the homeowner's attorney, Ellen Wright said. \"He's going to do whatever he can to get to the bottom of this.\" Wright says the eviction process was peaceful. But police say they were called to the home twice in a two-hour period to \"keep the peace.\" Neighbors reported hearing explosions at the home when the fire broke out. The fire is under investigation. No injuries were reported. The home was deemed a total loss. Wright says her client will be cooperating fully with investigators.

Charlie Baker told 7's Sharman Sacchetti that when it comes to the opioid crisis, he wants to bring what his administration has done in Massachusetts to a national level. \"I view it as hopefully an opportunity to put on the national stage some of the solutions that I believe we've been pursuing here in Massachusetts,\" Baker said. Baker will serve on President Donald Trump's commission to tackle the country's opioid addiction crisis. Baker learned about the opportunity from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime ally, who Trump tapped to lead the commission. \"The call I got was originally from Gov. Christie in New Jersey. He and I have talked about opioids and addiction generally a lot over the course of the past several years,\" Baker said. Baker has made the opioid crisis a major focus of his administration. Last year, he signed into law sweeping changes. Those changes included limiting painkillers to a seven day supply, setting an evaluation requirement within 24 hours for overdose victims seeking help in emergency rooms and allowing patients the ability to fill only part of their painkiller prescriptions at a time. But Baker has long tried to distance himself from some of Trump's comments and policies. He has said publicly that he didn't vote for Trump. Joining Trump's commission marks the first time that the governor can be linked to the administration. Baker said he was not worried when asked if he was concerned about being tied to Trump. \"I think this issue, the opioid epidemic, is something that certainly here in Massachusetts and I believe the rest of the country, is not a partisan issue,\" Baker said. The commission will release a full opioid report later in the year. Recommendations will be presented within 90 days.",
