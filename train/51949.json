If you acquired the software in Canada, the laws of the province where you live govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for breach of it, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of law principles. \nc. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.\n\n12. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights.
