Some of the features include: compass, HUD mode, speed graph, background track logging, speed warning, acceleration times and GPX track export. This app is suitable for running, car driving, biking or hiking.\n\nPlease note that the accuracy of speed readings depends on your GPS reception quality, which can be affected by a multitude of error-introducing factors.\n\nAlso note that this app is not optimized to run on tablets and some phones that have unusual screen resolutions. You will be able to run and use it, but it may not display as we intended.\n\nWe use Sense360, a third party technology provider, to help us better understand how our users use SpeedView and their devices. SpeedView sends raw sensor data generated by your device to Sense360. This sensor data may include information from GPS receivers, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other sensors, which may allow Sense360 to determine, for example, your device’s location, acceleration, and orientation. Sense360 may use this data to send us analytic reports regarding how our users are using SpeedView and their devices, or for marketing purposes. To learn more, please visit Sense360’s privacy policy, available at: http://sense360.com/privacy-policy.html.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them on our blog or send us an email directly using the button below.
