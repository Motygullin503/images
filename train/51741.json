Trauma to the hair follicles (traction alopecia) from certain hair styles can cause localized loss of hair as can chemicals applied to the scalp from hair treatments and colorings. Hair loss can be a normal part of aging and is called common baldness (androgenic alopecia). This type of hair loss is hereditary and the earlier it begins the worse the baldness becomes with time.",

In men with this type of baldness, the hair growth cycle changes in response to a type of testosterone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Over time hair follicles get thinner and shorter. Eventually, areas of the scalp stop growing hair altogether. Women that produce excess male hormones are more likely to experience this at a younger age. Men tend to experience hair loss mostly at the temples and top of the scalp. Women tend to lose hair in a more widespread fashion.   ",
