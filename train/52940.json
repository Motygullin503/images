While shopping take your shoes off and stand on the floor in your stocking feet and see how it feels.  Is the floor comfortable or too hard under your feet?  Put your shoes back on and go for a walk and see how the floor sounds on the noise level. Today's kitchens are more open than ever attaching to the den or even opening up to the great room.  The noise from shoes can create problems while others are talking or watching TV.  Remember too that the kitchen is typically the busiest spot in the house so you want a floor that wears well too.  With the kids and the animals it doesn't take long to wear the floor down, not to mention all the foot traffic and spills. Durability is important in today's full families and ease of maintenance should be taken into consideration too.",
