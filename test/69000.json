      "text": "Last year was a time of some major transitions for you, Ox. Hopefully you feel proud of yourself and the way that you handled all that change. You are a very stalwart and steady sign, and even when you encounter a challenge you tend to move forward with grace and strength. In 2015, you encountered people who could help you with your most important plans and dreams, and hopefully you took advantage of those connections. As you enter 2016, you may be feeling more vibrant and ready for anything, and that's excellent because this can be an auspicious year for you if you are prepared. This is the Year of the Fire Monkey, though, and that crazy energy could throw a monkey wrench into some of your plans. You can expect to encounter disappointments and distractions that make no sense at times, so you'll need to be focused to move beyond them.\n\nIf you took advantage of the new and powerful social connections that surrounded you in 2015, it is wise to nurture those same connections in the year ahead. These are people who can continue to help you improve yourself and expand your horizons. You may have also created a game plan for your career in the past year, and you can tap into those social contacts to advise and guide you along the way. Doing so could maximize your success.\n\nThe opportunities that you encounter in 2016 could represent the chance to make some of your biggest dreams come true. While many of these opportunities may seem to simply fall into your path, there will be others that you will have to fight for. It's time to put on your boots emotionally and head out to greet the future you have been dreaming about, because it is possible to make amazing progress toward your goals this year. Continue to be honest, caring, and kind, and good fortune will continue to follow you.\n\nLast year was a good year for relationships for the Ox, and hopefully you made the best of that. If you are single, you should be experiencing a renewed bond with your romantic partner throughout 2016. And, while there may be some shaky moments this year with your significant other, there is nothing you can't conquer if you remain unified as a team. If you were single last year, there would have been good chances to meet someone special. If that did not happen for you, then perhaps it wasn't meant to be for you just yet, but there will be additional chances in the year ahead. Be sure to say yes to any invitations or social gatherings that could involve Mr. or Ms. Right.\n\nFriendship will be in focus for Ox people this year too. You aren't someone who makes deep friendships easily but once you do, that person is a friend of yours for life. You may have a few surprises within your friendships this year, and they may change the way you relate to these individuals. That may be a challenge at first, but you will grow and evolve tremendously as you try to navigate the changes you encounter. This will bode well for your happiness in general, because solid friendships are an amazing source of strength and motivation.\n\nIf you plow forward in your characteristic noble style, Ox, and you do your best to deal with the sometimes-frustrating energy of this Monkey year, you can make steady progress and experience an enjoyable year.",
