If you intend to use this application in hunting, check first your local game law for legal use. Best results are achieved when you connect an external speaker.\n\n1. Cluck\nThis sound is a short, soft, single-syllable, non-musical tone. The plain cluck, many times, includes two or three single note clucks. This call is generally used by one bird to get the attention of another. It's a good call to reassure an approaching gobbler that a hen is waiting for him. \n\n2. Tree Yelp\nThe tree yelp is a softer, shorter version of the standard yelp. This is the first turkey sound heard in the morning. It is a turkey greeting call to make sure that all is well after a dark night of not seeing or hearing one another. Turkeys of both sexes tree yelp each morning.\n\n3. Yelp\nThe sound is one of the ones most people associate with turkeys. They use this sound to communicate with birds far away. \n\n4. Cutt\nCutting is a fast irregular series of clucks used by lost or lonely hens who are searching for other turkeys. It can be heard at a great distance and is especially effective call for the hunter in the spring because hens use cutting to announce to gobblers they are ready to mate. \n\n4. Whine\nThe Whine call, also referred to as the feed call is used any time of the year for turkeys that are feeding.\n\n5. Assembly Call\nThe adult hen assembly call is a series of loud yelps in order to assemble her flock or young poults.\n\n6. Fly Down Cackle\nThe cackle is generally associated with movement and is often heard when the bird is flying down from a roost. A cackle usually consist of three to 10 irregularly spaced notes. It's a movement call, so don't overuse it. \n\n7. Kee Kee Run\nThe kee kee is the lost call of young turkeys and variations made by adult birds. It's often associated with fall hunting, but can be used sporadically in the spring. \n\n8. Purr\nPurring is a soft, rolling call turkeys make when content. It has several meanings and is most commonly thought of as a call used to communicate contentment and relaxation when the flock is together or feeding. This is a very good call to coax the gobbler in the last few yards. This is not a loud call.\n\n9. Owl Hooting\nThe eight-note hoot of the barred owl is often used as a call to locate gobblers in the early morning or late evening hours. \n\n10. Gobbling\nThe gobble is one of the principal vocalizations of the male wild turkey and is used primarily in the spring to let hens know he is in the area. \n\n11. Fighting Purr\nThis is a loud and aggressive purr emitted by gobblers and jakes as they posture to fight for dominance and the right to breed. Turkeys love a good fight and you'll sometimes be stampeded by a group running up to get in on the fun. It is also a great call for the fall since turkeys are very actively fighting and establishing pecking orders during this season.\n\n",
