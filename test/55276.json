That is the most for a president's first 100 days in office since 1949. pic.twitter.com/OkkDYCVvlV\n\n— Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) April 29, 2017\n\n\"From the first day of my administration, I have governed by a simple idea: My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Together, we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American People first. That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" he added. \"That day was a turning point for our nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.\"\n\nThe unconventional president continues to buck tradition as he skips the White House Correspondents Dinner Saturday evening.\n\nHe announced last week via Twitter that he would hold a \"BIG rally\" in Pennsylvania instead.\n\n \n\nNext Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017\n\n \n\nHe traveled there late Friday evening with plans to sign a 31st and 32nd executive order, including one that would direct the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a study of U.S. trade agreements, the Associated Press reports.\n\nMeanwhile, protestors plan to hold an opposition rally and march in the city.\n\n",
