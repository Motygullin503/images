This application doesn't use your phone's minutes.\r\nYou can set up the language for speech recognition and translation using the  language menu located on the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nYou can use either \"Voice\" feature of the application or \"Key In\" option.\r\nThe \"Key In\" option is simple and self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nThe \"Voice\" option simulates a telephone call.\r\nStep 1: Press the [Voice] button.\r\n\r\nStep 2: You will be prompted to say the airline's name and flight number. Press the \"Speak\" button, then wait until a new screen with a picture of a microphone will appear, then say the airline's name and flight number. (For example: \"United Airlines 242\".) If application recognizes airline name and flight number, the application will say the name of the airline and flight number back and then show you the airline's code and flight number on the display screen. If airline or flight are not correct, press * (star) button and you will be transferred to Step 3.\r\n\r\nStep 3: You will be prompted to say the airline's name or enter the airline's code. Press the \"Speak\" button, then say the airline's name. If the name is recognized, the application will say the name of the airline back and then show you the airline's code on the display screen. If you think that the name was not recognized correctly, press the * (star) button and then repeat the previous step.\r\nAlternatively to using the \"Speak\" button, you can press the \"Search\" button, then select your airline from the worldwide list of airlines.\r\nYou can also enter the airlines code using the keypad of the application. \r\nFor example United Airlines has the code UAL. To enter it press the button\"8\" twice, then \"2\", then press \"5\" button three times. Each time you press a button, the number will be\r\nconverted into a letter and you will see it on the display screen. \r\nIf you need to enter the same letter twice, or a letter on the same key, for example \"ABC\", you will need to press \"2\" then wait 4 seconds until the phone beeps. (A beep means that letter is accepted.) Then press \"2\" twice, wait again, and then after that beep press \"2\" three times. Then press  the \"#\" (pound) button. The \"#\" always indicates that you've finish with your input or want to skip prompts.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Then the application will ask you to enter the flight number. Enter it using the application's keypad or press the \"Speak\"  button and say the flight number. Similarly to previous step you can re-enter the flight number if it was not correctly recognized by pressing \"*\" button. \r\nThen the system will warn you, \"Please wait\". In a few seconds the system will respond with the short information on your flight. \r\n\r\nStep 5: Then you can press the \"1\" button or wait a few seconds. At that time you will hear detailed information about a flight. If you need to repeat the last portion of information, press \"*\". To skip this and listen to the next portion of the information press \"#\".\r\nAfter announcing the detailed information the application will give you these choices: \r\n1. Repeat detailed information, 2. Get information about another flight,  or 3. End the call. \r\nTo end the call at any time simply press the \"Off\" button.\r\n \r\nStep 6: You can then view detailed information about your flight on your phone's screen. \r\nSimply press the \"View\" button and see all the data on the screen.\r\nTo return to the main screen of the application, press the standard Android return button.\r\n\r\nStep 7: You can then view maps of airports. Simply press the \"Arrival or \"Departure\" item of the list and see maps of chosen airport and vicinity. To see a Flight map, press \"Flight Details\".\r\nTo return to the main screen of the application, press the standard Android return button.\r\n",
