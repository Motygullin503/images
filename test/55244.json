High Risk Activities. The application is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use in environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or air traffic control, life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the application or network could lead directly to personal injury.\n\n5.

In no event shall WDT, its agents or employees, or the end user, and any affiliated companies and their agents, employees and directors be liable for any special, incidental, consequential or other damages whatsoever, (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the weather and hazardous conditions alerts, even if WDT or the end user have been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n6.  Termination. This License shall terminate immediately and without notice if you violate any part of this License.\n\n7.  Laws. The laws of the State of Oklahoma govern this License. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License shall continue in full force and effect.\n\n8.

Application of these Weather and Hazardous Conditions Alerts. Experience has shown that the resolution, timeliness, and format in which data for weather forecasts and the hazardous conditions are presented within various displays and products, does not provide a total solution with regard to addressing concerns regarding the presence of hazardous weather (including lightning) or other hazardous conditions and their potential impact on the safety of personnel and/or safeguarding of facilities, whether it be of immediate or short term concern. Interpretation and application of the data, as well as any comparative analysis and/or prognosis or similar activities done by any user, are done so solely at the user's risk and have not directly or indirectly been implied, condoned or recommended by WDT or their suppliers.\n\n12.
