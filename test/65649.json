This addon will make them larger, stronger and also run faster. Some of them you can ride such as chickens and rabbits. Almost all mobs have had their size modified and this really makes the world look kind of funny.\n\nHow does it work?\nEven though the horse is Godzilla-sized it’s still entirely possible to ride. Just make sure to set camera perspective in video settings to Third Person Back. I also recommend setting FOV (field of view) to max (51 is default in case you want to reset it later).\n\nThe horse is not only bigger but it’s also has more health and runs faster. And when it jumps it can literally jump over hills and small mountains.\n\nChickens and rabbits are also much bigger. And you can also ride (Android, iOS = long-tap + press Feed, Windows 10 = right-click) these mobs. Hold a carrot (for rabbits) or seeds (for chickens) in your hand to control them.\n\nDon’t play around with creepers. Their explosion has been slightly increase to cause some more damage.\n\nYou can tame a skeleton by tempting it with a bow. As soon as it is tamed it will turn into a wither skeleton. It will then follow you around and protect you whenever you are being attacked.\n\nHere is a list of all mobs which are much larger than before. Most of them also have more health and the hostile ones are stronger.\n\nChicken (supports two riders) (control with seeds)\nCow\nPig\nSheep\nWolf\nBat (supports two riders)\nRabbit (control with carrot)\nHorse (supports two riders)\nSkeleton Horse\nCreeper\nEnderman\nSlime\nSpider\nZombie\nWitch\nWither Boss (new!)\nOcelot (new!)\nVillager (new!)\nMooshroom (new!)\nDonkey (new!)\nStray (new!)\nBlaze (new!)\nSquid (new!)\nCave Spider (new!)\nMagma Cube (new!)\nChangelog\nMobs are 7x larger compared to 4x (hitboxes included)\n10 new giga mobs\nBats support two riders\nSkeletons are stronger have wear iron armor\nSpiders attack skeleton\nHorses jump higher and run faster\nAll mobs are faster\nSeat position fixed\nFloating baby mob heads fixed",
