Clinical depression is a biological condition in which sadness (or apathy) becomes so overwhelming that it interferes with your daily life. \n\nWhen you have depression, it is hard to enjoy life, concentrate, and do daily tasks like you used to. You may feel hopeless, unmotivated, persistently down, or very irritable. However, there is hope! With the help of therapy and medication, millions of people have already overcome their depression, and we want to present this same hope to you. \n\nAdditionally, this application provides multiple tools to help you lift your mood. If you feel like you may be suffering from depression, be sure to take the Depression Test to get a general sense of your symptom severity. In the Videos section, you can check out helpful videos or curate your own list of mood-boosters. Challenge your negative thoughts by identifying the cognitive distortions within them in the Thought Diary. Perform engaging activities in the Activities section and measure how they impact your mood. If you are dealing with suicidal thoughts, create a Safety Plan to help keep you safe.",
