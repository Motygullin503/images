Expand your abdomen when inhaling and contract it when exhaling \nIII. Breathing deeply and slowly, with one inhale and one exhale each taking 5 seconds. Hold your breath at every interval for about 1 second.\nIV. Not laughing and talking while practicing. Focus on your regular breathing thus to further relax your body.\n\nAbout Stretching\n\nI. Stretch your body intensely when inhaling. Relax your muscles when exhaling.\nII. Be at ease while practicing. Feel infinite power generated from you abdomen. Enjoy the delightful feelings of extending.\nIII. Stretch to the point of mild discomfort, not to the point of pain. Never bounce. Reduce the intensity of this stretch by not straightening the arms as much. Remember not to push your self too hard.\n\n* Coordinate every movement with your steady breathing. Maintenance and balance is rather important in a safe practicing.\n",
