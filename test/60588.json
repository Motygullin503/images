      "text": "THINKING ABOUT GETTING A TATTOO?\n\n Getting a tattoo is a serious decision. It is important to arm yourself with as much information as possible. This is a basic guideline for what to look for when choosing a studio and a tattoo artist. Included are precautions meant to help prevent cross-contamination of blood borne diseases from one client to the next and instructions on how to care for your new tattoo.\n\n These guidelines are based on a combination of vast professional experience, common sense, research and extensive clinical practice. This is not to be considered a substitute for medical advice from a doctor.\n\n Be aware, however, that many doctors have no specific training or experience regarding tattoos and may not be educated on how to best assist you.\n\nALWAYS INSIST FOR CLEAN AND STERILE EQUIPMENT\n\n Only ultrasonically cleaned and freshly sterilized instruments should be used for tattooing. Ultrasonic units use ultrasonic waves to disintegrate ink debris, blood and plasma off of tattoo instruments ensuring superior uniform cleaning.\n\n The only acceptable means of sterilization is by an autoclave. The autoclave should be spore tested, at least, monthly to ensure that it is functioning properly.\n\n NEEDLES SHOULD BE SINGLE USE ONLY\n\n Make sure your tattooist removes new needles and tubes from sealed autoclave bags in front of you. Autoclave bags have color indicators to show that they have been sterilized in an autoclave. However, these indicators can change colors even if the autoclave is not working properly. This is another reason you should ask to see autoclave test records.\n\n Be certain that your tattooist pours fresh ink into new disposable ink caps. Under NO circumstances should ink that has been poured out or used, be poured back into ink bottles.\n\n All tattooists should wash their hands and put on a new pair of gloves when starting a tattoo.\n\n Make sure that any item that may be touched during the tattoo process is covered by plastic or barrier film, to avoid cross contamination.\n\n Cross contamination is the act of spreading potential pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms from one item or surface to another.\n\n Even if a tattooist has on new gloves but touches a cross contamination item or surface, you are then in danger of those pathogens being transferred to your freshly broken skin. The best way to prevent cross contamination from one client to the next is by covering all surfaces that a tattooist might touch during the tattoo process with disposable plastic or barrier film. Items that should be covered include spray bottles, clip cords, lamps, knobs on power supplies and chair adjustments.\n\n Be sure your artist does not touch anything with dirty gloves, and that all items are wiped down with a disinfectant in between tattoos as an extra precautionary step.\n\n LASTLY\n\nEnjoy your new tattoo, why not send it to us to be included in the gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n",
