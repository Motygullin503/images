      "text": "We know that Ekta Kapoor and Anurag Kashyap's production Udta Punjab landed in major trouble when Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) ordered several cuts due to abusive language, drug problems and use of the name 'Punjab' in the film. Even Punjab word from the title was asked to be removed. It just did not end there. Things got ugly between Udta Punjab team and Censor board Chief Pahlaj Nihalani on the grounds of censorship. \n     Anurag Kashyap's production Phantom films is co-producing the film and decided to call out the bullying of censor board and not go through with the ordered 94 cuts. A press conference was also held earlier this week in order to protest against CBFC. The Udta Punjab team got support from industry filmmakers at the press meet.  \n     Though Ekta Kapoor did not address the issue herself on that day, an official statement has been released by her production house. Here's what they have to say about the whole issue:  \n     \"At a time when no studio was willing to come on board and fund Udta Punjab, it was Ekta Kapoor and its studio Balaji Motion Pictures that stepped up and backed the film that others found too risky. Now with the film embroiled in a standoff with the censor board, the makers stand on the precarious ground with regard to its release, which is slated for 17th June.  \n     With over 40 crores riding on the film's production and marketing costs, if it misses its planned release date, there will be a big financial blow to the studio. While Balaji has been fighting to get the film cleared keeping the creative vision of the director intact, the financial blow would be sizeable if there is a delay in the release of the film. Ekta being well aware of the repercussions and losses has decided to back the creativity of the film even at the expense of incurring additional costs in the event of a delay in release.\"  \n     As of now, all we can do is wait for the verdict to be out on whether the film will be released on the scheduled date or not. Udta Punjab stars Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Diljit Dosanjh which focuses on the drug menace in the Punjab.",
