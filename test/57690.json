How it looks like, how it feels and more importantly, how the game is played in the end game. The questions can easily be answered using the FHX server.\n\nOne more way players can take advantage of the servers is to try out different strategy for the game. High-level players don’t want to risk anything. Every single trophy is important to them. Hence, making practicing important.\nreal CoC servers:\nThe real CoC servers just don’t provide such level of freedom with the game mechanics. You need to learn using trial and error, and that might be a costly affair for serious players.\nThe players can easily try out the Simulation server, invite friends to them and try out some friendly matches. They can also fight against other rivals on the server who are looking to have some fun.\nMany casual players can also take advantage of the server. Not everyone like collecting trophies and gaining rank.",
