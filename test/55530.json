The calculations it makes relies on accurate data.

Use of this app constitutes your acceptance of these terms. Ignorance of these terms does not release you from them.\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean?\r\n\r\nThis software is a tool. Just as a hammer is a tool, but for a different job. If you use this software tool, and end up with incorrect recap values, or worse, a citation, its not the developers, or distributers, fault. Just as if you hit your thumb with a hammer, it isn't the fault of the guy that made the hammer, nor the guy's fault that sold it to you. It's your fault you missed the nail.\r\n\r\nNor can it be counted on to get an entire job done. It is a tool that will assist you, not do it for you, just as a hammer can assist you in building a new home, but it can't build it for you by itself.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that you enjoy using Recap.
