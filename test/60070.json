      "text": "Jesus made many outrageous claims while on Earth. You’re probably familiar with most of them: \n    \n“I am God.”“You need to worship me.”“I am God come from Heaven in human form.”“I am the only way to Heaven.”\nJesus didn’t just say these things just once. He said them multiple times. But his claims weren’t anything new. In fact, they still aren’t unique 2,000 years later. Lots of people claim to be God. What’s the difference between Jesus’ claim and everyone else’s? \nJesus said he would prove his claims by rising from the dead. And that’s exactly what he did.\nJesus didn’t make this prediction once. He made it over and over again. Everyone would have known about these predictions. At first, his predictions were vague. He’d use metaphors that you’d have to know what you were looking for to pick up. \nBut as his death got closer, Jesus’ predictions became more specific — and crystal clear. Jesus said, (Matthew 20:18-19 HCSB).“Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death. Then they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified, and He will be resurrected on the third day” \nDid Jesus keep his word? Absolutely! That’s why today two-thirds of the world celebrates Easter. It’s why your birthday is dated according to the Resurrection of Jesus.\nThe only reason people doubt the divinity of Jesus is because they don’t want to believe it. Jesus offered plenty of proof he is who he says he is.\nAnd because he is who he says he is, Jesus split history into two, and billions of lives throughout the ages, including mine, have been changed.\nI hope yours was, too.\nTalk It Over \nWhy do you think the Resurrection is such a convincing proof that Jesus was God?Why do some people still choose not to accept the truth about Jesus despite his Resurrection?Your friends and family members may be more open to discussing the Resurrection of Jesus as Easter nears than at any other time during the year. Who can you share that story with this week?\n",
