It's almost impossible to find anyone who has not been touched in some way by the disease.\n\nSo when the Krewe of Selene rolls in Slidell on Friday night,there will be a \"float-load\" of celebrating going on. For the second year in a row, the nearly 500-member, all-female krewe will roll a \"Fight Cancer\" float -- all of the riders with reason to stand up and cheer.\n\n\"Oh my gosh! You know, it's just they always are stepping up, no matter what we ask them to do, they'll step up,\" said Margaret Diaz, the community-outreach coordinator for the Krewe of Selene.\n\nWith reasons close to the hearts of their members, the Krewe of Selene reached out to cancer survivors last year. The response was overwhelming. \n\n\"You never realize until you start meeting them face-to-face, or you know someone personally,\" Diaz said.\n\nA day before the much-anticipated parade, the \"Fight Cancer float was being decorated by a number of the cancer survivors invited to ride and revel in the Friday night parade. Some are former krewe members. Others come with a well-deserved invitation. All have one thing in common:They beat cancer and that's reason to celebrate.\n\n\"It is! It's wonderful to sit there and see all the sea of people that know me just shouting my name. I'm glad that I can experience that,\" JoAnne Smith said.\n\n\"Family's out there. I have a son coming in from Dallas. He's all excited. So it's great,\" Linda Phillips said.\n\nIf you look closely at the \"Fight Cancer\" sign on the side of the float, the words \"I can\" are found. They are a message of hope to those in the crowd with loved ones battling cancer, or who may be fighting that battle themselves. Cancer can be beaten.\n\n\"It means a lot. It means I'm recognized, and that you can survive cancer. I'm doing it,\" Teresa Lymuel said.\n\nThe \"Fight Cancer\" float was built by Ronnie Natal and Da Floats and designed by Mardi Gras Decorators of Slidell. That and all the throws for the parade are donated for this \"victory lap.\"\n\n\"They are all fighters. They are all champions,\" Diaz said.\n\nThe face of the float is a wreath of ribbons, each signifying a different cancer. They are ringed in light symbolizing the ongoing fight to find a cure and the will to survive.\n\n",
