Some problems and experiences can leave you feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. Feeling suicidal is not a sign of weakness, and it doesn't mean that you are weak or crazy. Thinking of suicide occurs when pain exceeds the resources for coping with that pain. You may think that you have no options left and suicide would be a way to escape intense emotional pain. But while this pain may seem overwhelming and permanent, with time and support, you can overcome your problems and the pain, as well as the suicidal feelings, will pass. \n\nTake hope in the fact that people DO get through this, even when they are feeling as badly as you do now. There is a very good chance that you are going to live through these feelings, no matter how much pain you are currently experiencing. \n\nThis application is designed to support you and help you deal with your suicidal urges when they arise so that you may continue on the path to recovery. Please take the time to read this guide and fill out the Safety Plan. The Safety Plan will come in handy when you have thoughts of hurting yourself. Once it is completed, you can follow the steps outlined in your Safety Plan to cope with your emotional pain. If following the Safety Plan is not enough to alleviate your pain, you can call for help or find a local emergency center through the Crisis tab of the app.",
