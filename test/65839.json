          "text": "32 years ago, a friend of mine drove about an hour south of here to purchase a 1937 Ford 2dr sedan for $1800. When he got back with it, he told me (because I loved 36's and driving a white 36 3wdw at the time) I needed to go down and see the old guy, because he had a 36 Ford roadster for sale also for $3500. It was the middle of the week, and I couldn't head down till Saturday, but when Saturday came I drove down to buy it. When I got there the older man told me that it was no longer for sale. He said another guy that came by to buy it, and told the old man it was only worth maybe $1800. He said it ticked him off, and the car was not for sale. I went down several months later to see if he had changed his mind, but he had moved away and left the car in the care of a friend. Frequently I would go south and check on the status of the car, always the same answer, he's not selling it. Fast forward 32 years later 3/23/2017, I went down to check the status again, and look at the car, it's still not for sale. Then 3 days later I get a call, you should have this car, come down and we will figure out a deal, so I went down to see him on cloud 9. A little history, it's not a 36, it's a 35 rdstr, the man is 82-83 years old, he said the car was his fathers, and that he gave it to him when he was 16, as a father son project. If my math is correct that was 1951. A deal was struck for my burgundy 32 Pontiac sedan, new white wall tires installed, and some cash. I went down last Saturday to see what was there, and what was missing, and went down yesterday to haul all the parts from the roadster, and all the spare parts home. Will be going down this week to pick up the roadster, and a 35 2dr that comes with it. Enclosed are some pictures from when I first saw it 32 years ago, and a few pictures of it and spare parts after unpacking the car. And a couple shots of the 35 2dr. ",
