Having a plan in place that can help guide you through difficult moments can make a difference and keep you safe. Ideally, such a plan is developed jointly with your counselor or therapist. It can also be developed with a crisis line counselor who can help you write down actions to take and people to contact in order to feel safe from suicide. In general, a safety plan is designed so that you can start at step one and continue through the steps until you feel safe. When you have thoughts of suicide, refer to your safety plan. \n\nThe following are essential elements to explore and include in the development of your safety plan:\n\n1. Recognize warning signs: What sorts of thoughts, images, moods, situations, and behaviors indicate to you that a crisis may be developing? Write these down in your own words. \n\n2. Use your own coping strategies – without contacting another person: What are some things that you can do on your own to help you not act on thoughts/urges to harm yourself?\n\n3. Remind yourself of your reasons for living: What are things that are most important to you? \n\n4. Contact family members or friends who may help to resolve a crisis: Make a list of family members who are supportive and who you feel you can talk to when under stress. \n\n5. Contact mental health professionals or agencies: List clinicians that you can contact during times of duress or call a suicide prevention hotline. \n\n6. Find a place with others who may offer support as well as distraction from the crisis: Make a list of healthy social settings that may help take your mind off things.",
