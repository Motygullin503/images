We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, services or customized experiences.\n\n\nIf you choose to submit content for publication (for example, a posting to a blog or a discussion board, or a video), we may publish your screen name, email address, or other information you have provided to us. We may on occasion combine information we collect through our Sites with information that we collect from other sources. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you register and create a profile with our Sites, the screen name you select as well as other content you submit to your profile (e.g., photos, comments, video, reviews) will be displayed publicly on the Sites and may be reused and redistributed by us in our sole discretion, as set forth in our Terms of Use.\n\n\nBounce, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners use the Non-Personally Identifiable information that is collected to improve the design and content of our Sites, to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements, to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, and to perform analytics.

We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe in our sole discretion it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.\n\n\nIn addition, we may transfer information if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, merged with or otherwise transferred to another entity.\n\n\nOur agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement and are not authorized to use the personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.\n\n\nWe may disclose personally identifiable information and/or Non-Personally Identifiable Information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement. For example, we may share such personally identifiable information we collect with Bounces to provide, improve and communicate with you about their own products and services.\n\n\nWe may also share such information with unaffiliated business partners and third parties (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you.

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the Site’s activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such personally identifiable information.\n\n\nTo provide visitors with additional or more relevant product and service opportunities, to improve and personalize the Sites and to perform analytics, and for the additional uses discussed in this privacy statement, we may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with the third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners.\n\n\n  Cookies, Web Beacons, Analytics and Advertising\n\nTo enhance your online experience, we use \"cookies\" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.\n\n\nWe use cookies to understand Site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our Sites.

This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.\n\n\nThe Adobe Flash Player is web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Bounce Sites employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) in certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video streaming, video on demand, video clips or animation.

Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\n\n\n  How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals \n\nAt this time the Bounce Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.

Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Bounce Sites. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information.\n\n\n  Analytics \n\nWe also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and website and mobile application analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons or similar technologies for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.\n\n\n  Advertising \n\nThe Bounce Sites may contain advertising. Ads on the Bounce Sites may be based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we may also provide ads that are tailored to your interests.

Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, when using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.\n\n\n  Linked Sites \n\nSome Bounce Sites may contain links to or integrations with other sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or sites operated by other third parties.
