It will single out your primary love language, what it means, and how you can use it to connect with your loved one with intimacy and fulfillment.\n\nYou will now see 30 paired statements. Please select the statement that best defines what is most meaningful to you in your relationship as a couple. Both statements may or may not sound like they fit your situation, but please choose the statement that captures the essence of what is (or would be) most meaningful to you, the majority of the time. Allow 10 to 15 minutes to complete the profile. Take it when you are relaxed, and try not to rush through it.\n\nProvide your contact information below and you will receive your personal profile results emailed to you. This profile is for ages 18 and older.\n",
