We will continue to work hard to provide PHOLAR Service in consistent and continuous manner, and we hope you can better understand PHOLAR Service by this Terms of Use.\n\n\n\nPlease see below for definition of terms used in this Terms of Use. \n\n“Content” means any data, text, files, information, usernames, images, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, links and other content or materials that you submit, post or display on or via Service.\n\n“Service” (or “PHOLAR Service”) is an interest based social network service made available by NAVER in which users who otherwise do not know each other post and share photos and videos with comments.\n\n“User” is a person who agrees to be bound by the Terms of Use. \n\n\n\nWe post the Terms of Use, so the User can easily access it; we may modify it from time to time.\n\nWe post Terms of Use within Service, so Users can easily access it, and we may amend it as provided by applicable law. In the event of amendment, we may notify User about the amendment within the Service by posting its date and reason; we may also use electronic means to notify User for material amendment. \n\n\n\nTerms of Use and User Policy, based on their order of priority, complement each other. \n\nMatters not specified in this Terms of User may be set forth in separate User Policy, respective laws and regulations, or applicable commercial practice. \n\n\n\nThere is a process required to use the Service. \n\nA binding agreement is formed when an applicant who intends to become a User(“Applicant”) agrees to the terms of the Terms of Use, submits an application to become User, and NAVER accepts this application. Applicant may open User account for PHOLAR by using his/her NAVER ID or other service account. NAVER will accept the application absent existence of unusual circumstance. User can start using the Service freely once NAVER accepts the application. \n\n\n\nWe strive to protect User’s Personally Identifiable Information (“PPI”) \n\nNAVER only shall use the User’s PPI in accordance with respective laws to provide the Service. Please read our Privacy Policy [link] for more details. \n\n\n\nWe strive to provide proper notice. \n\nWhen NAVER sends notice to User, unless otherwise provided, it will be made within Service or be made in other manner that NAVER deems appropriate. For notice that applies to all Users, it shall constitute a valid notice if NAVER posts the notice on the first page of PHOLAR Service or notice board for seven(7) days or longer. \n\n\n\nWe listen to our Users. \n\nWe strive to provide continuous and reliable service while complying with all applicable laws and regulations. We also maintain proper security system for User to use the Service in a secure manner, and we also post and comply with our Privacy Policy [link].  If we receive a legitimate comment or complaint from a User regarding the Service, we strive to reflect it. When necessary, we may use the notice board or use other means that we deem appropriate to inform User about how his/her complaint or comment is being handled. \n\n\n\nThere are few cautions when using the Service. \n\nWe retain all intellectual property rights relating to Service, except User’s intellectual property rights on Content. User shall not amend, change, or restrict any posting or other similar material provided by us relating to the Service. User shall not change any information we provided within the Service, or use the Service for profit without our consent.

When there is a change in the Service’s content, using method, or operating hours, then we will post the cause, content, and date of this change, as well as other applicable details, on notice board within the Service or other method by which the User can recognize this fact, prior to the change. Unless otherwise provided in applicable law, we will not compensate User because of any change or cessation of Service, which is being provided free of charge. \n\n\n\nWe can provide diverse information. \n\nWe can provide a variety of information that User may need while using the Service via, notice within the Service, push alarm, or through other means, and User may choose not to receive them at any time except when it is information legally required to be provided to User or an answer to an inquiry by a User. However, in accordance with applicable law, if we plan to provide information that is advertisement for profit in nature via electronic means, we will receive a separate User consent prior to sending such information.   \n\n\n\nWe ask you to work together to protect copyright. \n\nUser may upload Content or write comment via his/her account. Contents uploaded on his/her account may be searched, collected, linked in other sites. If User is the copyright holder of the uploaded Content, (s)he retains all rights relating to the Content and (s)he is responsible for the rights.

User whose Content has been taken down may protest and explain that takedown is not applicable and request for reloading the Content. Please refer to User Policy for more details. NAVER may restrict the User from using the Service if (s)he violates obligation under this Terms of Use or interferes with the normal operation of the Service. In case of permanent restriction from using the Service, any and all privileges the former User acquired via Service will expire without compensation. Please refer to User Policy for more detail. \n\nWhen we put User on restriction temporarily or permanently, we shall notify User, and User may state his/her objection according to policy set forth by NAVER. If such objection is valid, we shall promptly allow the User to use the Service.  \n\n\n\nWe reserve the right to take any and all legal actions against illegal or unauthorized use of the Service. \n\nWe reserve the right to take down or delete Content without prior notice, if the Content infringes on the right of third party, e.g., intellectual property right, violates law, or violates Terms of Use or User Policy.
