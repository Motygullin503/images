No additional account setup or subscription is required. Please note, credits are charged for all faxes and credits are charged at the time that you initiate a fax. Canceling a fax once it has been started will not result in a return of credits. \n \nFaxFile supports documents in PDF and Microsoft office word format (.doc or .docx) and images in PNG and JPG formats (such as the images saved by the camera, if your android has one). \n \nFaxFile requires internet access to function. Your service provider may charge additional fees for internet access. You are solely responsible for all charges incurred and FaxFile will not reimburse you for any such charges.",
