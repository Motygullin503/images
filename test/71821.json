Enable your Spider-Sense to locate the three antennas, moving to decrypt each one. When you're done, open up the map of Manhattan to see a list of petty crimes taking place around the city.\n \n One of the crimes will be highlighted, so head that way to find five thugs begging for a fight. Hop down and take them on, dodging their attacks while taking them on one at a time. Once you defeat a few, one of the bad guys will set fire to a nearby building. Jump through the window and turn on your Spider-Sense to locate trapped civilians in the building. After rescuing the civilian, it's revealed to be Stan Lee, one of Spidey's biggest fans.\n \n Following a cut scene, head to the Comic Stand indicated on your map. Explore the shop if you feel like it, exiting when you're done.\n \n After another cut scene, you'll receive a new objective marker on your map. Follow it to locate Uncle Ben's killer, who steals a car and takes a hostage. Use your Web Rush to land on top of the car. Open the back left door and take out the thug in the backseat. Move around to the back of the car, using the Web Pull feature to rescue the civilian inside. Once the hostage is safe, get back on Carradine's trail.\n\n",
