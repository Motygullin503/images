      "text": "Go through the seasons\nPlay the seasons in order to complete the achievements and get huge rewards in terms of coins. Grinding on the seasons early on is the only thing you should focus on, maybe alternating with a versus game here and there. For most of the other things, your team will be too weak at first. Go through the seasons as fast as possible, complete them and get a ton of coins to use them later on to improve your team even more.\n\nLearn the moves\nThere are multiple moves that you can pull in the game, like spin moves, fadeaways, behind the back and so on. I will have a guide on how to perform each of these moves shortly in case you can’t figure it out on your own – but if you do and once you do, start pulling those in order to get the advantage on the field and dominate your opponent.\n\nHow to make more coins\nThere are a lot of methods to make more money in NBA Live Mobile and most of the tips in this article help you get more (UPDATE: we’ve published a complete guide on how to make coins fast in NBA Live Mobile, make sure to check it out as well!), but the easiest way to make money is to use the Auctions. Buy low and sell high is the easiest thing to do: once you have some money, simply snipe for cards that are greatly undervalued, purchase them with the buy it now price and then resell them at their regular value. Keep an eye on the market in order to know the prices and be very active and you can score the likes of Kobe for example for as low as 3-4,000 coins. Now that’s insane in resale value, but also great help for your team.\n",
